    "1. **DateTime**  \n",
    "2. **Taxi Available Throughout Singapore**  \n",
    "3. **Taxi Available in Selected Box Area**  \n",

    "- **Output:** `Taxi Available in Selected Box Area` will be the target variable.  \n",
    "- **DateTime Conversion:** Since `DateTime` is not in a format suitable for neural networks, we will extract relevant features:\n",
    "  - **IsWeekend**: A binary feature (1 if it's a weekend, 0 otherwise).  \n",

    "4. **Number of Taxi Stands in the Area**  \n",
